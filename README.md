# Getting Started with this Node App

Welcome to the back wildbook app!
To start you need to pull two repositories:

- the back: `git clone https://github.com/feliciebernard/wild-front-react.git`
- the front: [get to the back repository](https://github.com/feliciebernard/wild-front-react.git)

If you have docker, get started-me just with one command! ==> docker compose up --build

If you don't have docker:

- `npm i`
- `npm start`
